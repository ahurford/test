You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports; for example, a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). 1.1 Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 1.2 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select “All formats” if you’d like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() To render this example to PDF as a bookdown::pdf_book, you’ll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. 1.3 Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in “Preview book”, or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() "],["schedule.html", "2 Schedule", " 2 Schedule Thurs Jan 5: Introduction Fri Jan 6: Population biology with discrete and continuous variables Tues Jan 10: Introduction to Rmarkdown and tidyverse Assignment 1 is assigned Thurs Jan 12: Geometric growth Fri Jan 13: Geometric growth Tues Jan 17: Numerical solutions and graphing population data Assignment 1 is due &amp; Assignment 2 is assigned Thurs Jan 19: Exponential growth Fri Jan 20: Exponential growth Tues Jan 24: Density dependence and logistic growth Assignement 2 is due Thurs Jan 26: Density dependence and logistic growth Fri Jan 27: Density dependence and logistic growth Tues Jan 31: Discrete time density dependence Thurs Feb 2: EXAM I Fri Feb 3: Age-structured models Tues Feb 7: Stage-structured models Thurs Feb 9: Stage-structured models Fri Feb 10: Stage-structured models Tues Feb 14: Numerical analysis of stage-structured models Assignment 3 is assigned Thurs Feb 16: Density dependence in stage-structured models Fri Feb 17: Metapopulation models WINTER BREAK Tues Feb 28: Continuous space models Assignment 3 is due Thurs Mar 2: Spatially explicit models in population biology Fri Mar 3: Population dynamics in a warming world Tues Mar 7: Spatially explicit population dynamics in a warming world Thurs Mar 9: Disease dynamics Fri Mar 10: The net reproduction number Tues Mar 14: Overview of models in population biology Thurs Mar 16: EXAM II Fri Mar 17: What is evolutionary ecology?

Like this one 1. 4.2 Citations Reference items in your bibliography file(s) using @key. For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2022) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key. The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations References "],["parts.html", "5 Parts", " 5 Parts You can add parts to organize one or more book chapters together. Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 6.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file. Read more about the features of this output format here: https://pkgs.rstudio.com/bookdown/reference/gitbook.html Or use: ?bookdown::gitbook "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
