Course description: Population and Evolutionary Ecology is an introduction to the theory and principles of evolutionary ecology and population dynamics. Pre-requisites: BIOL 2600; at least one of BIOL 2010, 2122 or 2210. Course format: The course consists of lectures, 4 data analysis assignments, 2 exams and a final exam.  Course expectations: Please attend lectures and respect the learning environment of other students. If you have COVID-19 please follow university and provincial public health guidelines. Learning goals: The course content emphasizes a deeper understanding of fewer concepts. You have seen much of the course material in pre-requisite courses. In this course, I will revisit the models, clarify the assumptions and when they are appropriate, and we will fit the models to data to estimate parameters. By the end of the course, I hope that if you were given population data, that you would know the key quantities that you might estimate, and could complete the analysis.

PART I is to reproduce a figure and the figure caption of a plot in Vandermeer and Goldberg 2013 or another textbook or a published paper in Rmarkdown and as an output file: .hmtl, .pdf, or .docx. Please choose a figure to reproduce in the area of Population Biology or Evolutionary Ecology. You can simplify a complex figure if necessary. Your figure should be made in ggplot() and have: the title (if there is one), axes labels, points or lines or both, approximately the same data as the original figure, the correct axes limits. The objective is for you to learn how to use Rmarkdown to make a synthetic write-up that includes code, a figure and text. Your completed output should have: A brief text description of where I can find the figure you reproduced. Code that makes a figure that is suppressed in the output file. The reproduced figure (or simplified figure). The actual figure You are to hand-in the .Rmd file and an output file (.html, .pdf, or .docx) Here, is an example of what a completed PART 1 looks like (as an .html output).

FIGURE 3.1 Difference in per capita egg production between the O lines and B lines from Rose and Charlesworth’s (1981) experiment. Instructions to complete PART I are here. PART II of this assignment is to clean up messy data. As a biologist, much of my coding work involves getting data into the right format to use in functions, this might be a plot function like ggplot(), which you used in PART I, or a statistical function like lm(), which will perform a regression, t-test, or analysis of variance. The objective of PART II is to practice cleaning messy data into a useable format. You are to clean the messy data from here enough so you can make a plot using ggplot(). Some helpful instructions for how to do this are here. The code that you write must use the select(), mutate(), and ggplot() functions. The graph that you make must be different than the example given in the instructions - for example, you might plot the same variables but for Plot 2. (perhaps this sounds easy - this data is pretty messy - I found it quite hard!)

Pay specific attention to the number of pheasants at different points in time, these might be \\(N_{t+1}\\) and \\(N_t\\) in the geometric growth model formula; and the number of births and deaths that occur, these may help you estimate \\(\\lambda\\) in the geoemtric growth formula. Pay attention to the length of time that births and deaths are reported over, and what time of the year the population size is reported. Newcomb, HR. 1940. Ring-necked pheasant studies on Protection Island in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Washington. MS thesis. Oregon State University. [two pages prior to the title page] Noteably, Pheasant chicks are born during the summer. In May 1937, 10 pheasants were introduced to the island. Before the next breeding season there were 35. November 10, 1938 a census estimated 110 pheasants. October 13, 1939 a census estimated 400 pheasants. Between the 1938 and 1939 censuses, Newcomb observed that 17 adult birds died. During the 1938 nesting season there were 5.86 eggs/nest. 83.57% of eggs hatched. During the 1939 nesting season there were 8.73 eggs/nest. 64.58% hatched. During the 1939 nesting season: Average number of chicks per clutch was 6.93.\\(^1\\) You can assume the sex ratio is 50:50 male to female. Pheasants are a sexually reproducing species. \\(^1\\) Note that g. and h. appear to be contradictory. 7.2 Questions This approach is called independent parameter estimation because we will estimate the birth and mortality rates independently of the population size data for different years. \\(b &gt; 0\\) is the per capita number of births each year. The estimation of \\(b\\) for a geometric growth model is more subtle. First, \\(b\\) is estimated as the number of births (occurring between \\(t\\) and \\(t+1\\)), divided by the number of individuals that could have given birth, \\(N_t\\). You might average this value across multiple years if sufficient data are available. Furthermore, to correctly project the future population size, we should consider what we have assumed about survival of the pheasant chicks, given the time step of our model. Given a.-i. estimate \\(b\\). Write down any assumptions you have made. Is the probability that pheasants survive from one time step to the next. Estimate \\(d\\). What is the value of \\(\\lambda\\) given your estimate of \\(b\\) and \\(d\\) from previous questions? Is this population is expected to grow over time? Lets assume that the pheasant population on Protection Island grows geometrically (i.e. exponentially but for a discrete time model) where the geometric growth rate, \\(\\lambda\\), is the value that you estimated in question 3. Let \\(N_0 = 10\\) and let \\(t\\) be the number of years since May 1937. Recall that when a population grows geometrically, \\[ N_t = N_0 \\lambda^t \\] Use the formula and your answer to 3. to predict the number of pheasants in May 1938, May 1939, May 1940, and May 1950. "],["estimate.html", "8 Jan 19: ASSIGNMENT Estimating the geometric growth rate 8.1 Code 8.2 To hand in", " 8 Jan 19: ASSIGNMENT Estimating the geometric growth rate ASSIGNMENT 2 due Jan 26. You are to write an Rmarkdown report that estimates the geometric growth rate, \\(\\lambda\\), for the Protection Island pheasant population. Your report needs to consider two methods for estimating the geometric growth rate: fitting; and estimation from independent data. The code you will need to complete this assignment is below. You may copy and paste this code into your Rmarkdown report. Sometimes you will need to change the values. The requirements of the report follow the code. 8.1 Code 8.1.1 Loading and plotting the data Load the data. I copied the data on to a website, so it can be loaded with the command below. Click here to view the code on the website. data = read.csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahurford/biol-4605-data/main/data/protection-island.csv&quot;) Let’s plot the data. We select only columns 1 and 2 of the data because column 3 contains comments. We plot year on the horizontal (x-) axis and size on the (y-) vertical axis. require(ggplot2) protection.island &lt;- data[,1:2] g1 = ggplot(data = protection.island, aes(x = year, y = size)) + geom_point() + xlab(&quot;year&quot;)+ ylab(&quot;population size&quot;)+ ggtitle(&quot;Protection Island&quot;) g1 8.1.2 Function for geometric growth Below is the definition of a geometric growth function with time, \\(t\\), specifically defined for the number of years of Protection Island pheasant data, and the initial population size, \\(N_0\\), defined specifically for the Protection Island data. You need to give this function in your code before you call the function. geo.pred &lt;- function(lambda){ t = protection.island$year - protection.island$year[1] N0 = protection.island$size[1] size = N0*lambda^t pred = data.frame(year = protection.island$year, size = size) } The function is called by running geo.pred(lambda) in the console, where you enter a specific numerical value for lambda. After you have run the code (i.e. in the Console) that defines the geo.pred(lambda) function (above), try lambda = 3 as: result = geo.pred(3) result ## year size ## 1 1936 10 ## 2 1937 30 ## 3 1938 90 ## 4 1939 270 Remember, negative values of lambda are non-sensical. (For what values of lambda (or \\(\\lambda\\)), does the population grow, again? Not sure? You can try some values in the geo.pred(lambda) function to figure this out by experimentation.) Question 1 The geo.pred() function works by running the lines of code inside the geo.pred() function definition for the value of lambda that you supply (inside the parentheses in the function call). In the function definition, what are the lines of code that are pasted below doing? (Hint: What is the data frame protection.island? Note that data[1] selects the first value of a list of values and the $ selects a particular column of a data frame). t = protection.island$year - protection.island$year[1] N0 = protection.island$size[1] 8.1.3 Fitting lambda We have defined a function that will predict the population size of pheasants on Protection Island for different user supplied values of lambda. But what value of lambda is most likely given the data? To answer this question we will use a statistical method known as maximum likelihood. Our first step is to define a function that quantifies the fit of a given lambda value. This function assumes that deviations of the recorded data from the model-predicted values follow a Poisson distribution: geofit &lt;- function(lambda){ pred=geo.pred(lambda=lambda) Ypred = pred$size -sum(dpois(protection.island$size, Ypred, log=T)) } After running the geo.fit(lambda) function (in the Console), lets try to use the function and get some values of the negative log likelihood (i.e. the fit): geofit(3) ## [1] 41.64846 geofit(1) ## [1] 1280.129 This result tells us that given the data, lambda = 3 is much more likely than lambda = 1 because the negative log likelihood value (41.65) is much smaller. But what value of lambda is most likelihood given the data? Equivalently, for what value of lambda is the negative log likelihood minimized? To answer this question we need to call a function that will perform an optimization. This requires the mle2 function from the bbmle package, and you will need to install this package prior to using this function. library(bbmle) ## Loading required package: stats4 fit.geo &lt;- mle2(geofit, start=list(lambda=3)) summary(fit.geo) ## Maximum likelihood estimation ## ## Call: ## mle2(minuslogl = geofit, start = list(lambda = 3)) ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

In the code below, lambda = 3 is the estimated lambda value, and the 95% confidence interval is [2,4] (as example values). To use this code for your assignment you will need to substitute different values. fit.predictions = geo.pred(3)$size lower.fit = geo.pred(2)$size upper.fit = geo.pred(4)$size We had already made a plot of the data and we named our graph g1. We can now add some more layers to the graph as shown below. Note that the line is the value of fit.predictions as defined above (i.e., set =3 as an example), and the shaded ribbon spans from lower.fit to upper.fit (i.e., set to 2 and 4 as an example). g2 = g1 + geom_line(aes(y=fit.predictions)) + geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower.fit, ymax = upper.fit), alpha = .2) (The value of alpha = 0.2 makes the ribbon transparent) 8.2 To hand in Answer Question 1 which appears in bold in the Function for geometric growth section. [3 marks] Write an Rmarkdown report that estimates \\(\\lambda\\) (i.e. lambda) in the geometric growth rate function using maximum likelihood fitting. You must include a graph that shows: The data (shown as dots); The predicted values for the maximum likelihood estimate of lambda (shown as a line); The predicted values for the 95% confidence interval for the estimate of lambda (shown as a shaded region); You must include a figure caption that explains the main point of your graph, and what the symbols are. Your Rmarkdown file must contain a sequence of R commands that produces the graph. [10 marks] Estimate \\(\\lambda\\) from data independent of the time series describing the population size of pheasants on Protection Island. This means that you cannot use more than one value of the population size to estimate one value of a quantity (you should be using the population size in a given year to calculate per capita rates by dividing only). You goal is to keep your parameter estimation method independent from the time series of pheasant population size so that you can validate the assumptions of your geometric growth model. In your Rmarkdown report you should: Derive a formula for \\(\\lambda\\) in terms of \\(b\\), the per capita birth rate, and the probability of mortality \\(d\\) each year. Do this based on the class discussion on January 17 or by reading Otto and Day, 2007 Section 2.5.1 Discrete-Time Models p47-50 and omit migration (i.e. \\(m=0\\)) for the application to the Protection Island pheasant population. [2 marks] State some important assumptions of your \\(\\lambda\\) formula. [3 marks] Estimate \\(b\\) and \\(d\\) using some of the information given here. State assumptions that you have made when data is lacking or information is contradictory. Calculate \\(\\lambda\\) given the formula you derived. [4 marks] Use the geo.pred(lambda) function to predict the population size of pheasants on Protection Island for your independently estimated \\(\\lambda\\) value. The code to do this must be included in your Rmarkdown file. [2 marks] Make a plot of your predictions relative to the reported data. Include a figure caption that describes the main point of your figure and defines all the symbols. [3 marks] "],["partI.html", "PART I - Instructions", " PART I - Instructions For general instructions on installing R, RStudio and installing packages see the Quantitative Training Manual. Install the Rmarkdown package and all dependencies. Install tinytex. In the past we have had some problems with this on PCs. If your tinytex installation fails, what you might try is a package manager for Windows, i.e. Chocolatey or Scoop. See here for details. You are unsuccessful at installing tinytex that is okay, this package is only necessary to produce a .pdf output. You can complete your assignment as a .docx output or .html output. Why use R markdown? Integrate code and write-up to avoid mistakes moving between .R (or other software) for analysis and .docx for write-up. It is easier to find all your work when everything is in one file (or linked to from one file). Run code in the background of your write-up so that if something changes the write-up automatically updates in all the relevant places. The reduces the chances of errors in your write-up. Publish your work as a website. This facilitates hyper-linking, you can update your work at any time, avoiding emailing your work keeps email storage free, and your work can be easily shared (i.e., in conversation I might say ‘that analysis is linked off my faculty website’). Include math symbols quickly because your hands don’t leave the keyboard to make selections from drop-down menus. If your analysis is time-consuming you might not want the calculations in your write-up, slowing the compilation of your write-up. In this case you might have a separate .R analysis file that outputs your results as a .csv or plot. You can read these in automatically to your write-up by specifying the path to the .csv or plot. In R Studio, select File &gt; New Project... &gt; R Markdown. Give the file a name, etc. The default .Rmd opens already with some code to help you. With the default .Rmd opened, there should be a Knit button at the top and center of the Editor pane. Click the Knit button to knit to .pdf, .html, or .docx output. Alternatively, do Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + K. (If this did not work, perhaps you have not installed the rmarkdown or tinytex packages) Beside the Knit button is an arrow. You have the option to knit to .pdf, .html, or .docx output. Try producing other outputs. (For me, producing a .docx opened Skype (clearly a bug). This was fixed by using Finder (on my Mac) to find the .docx file that I made, and selecting Open With &gt; Microsoft Word) Below are some things to try, that will help you to complete PART I. Type the code, then Knit to see what happens. Include variables in-text by enclosing in $x$, i.e. this renders as \\(x\\), which is italicized to indicate in your writing that \\(x\\) is a variable rather than a letter. Load data using R commands. (If you want to do this quickly copy and paste the command at the end of this section) Hide the code that loads the data in the output. i.e., read about the options for r code chunks: echo, include, message, warning, eval, and results. Print the data in your output. Show both the code and the output. Try it all! Show only your code print out. Can you do this? ## Psoil Pcorn ## 1 1 64 ## 2 4 71 ## 3 5 54 ## 4 9 81 ## 5 13 93 ## 6 11 76 Include code in-text as `r x `. This renders as 80 because in a hidden coding block I loaded data and assigned x&lt;-mean(data$Pcorn). Therefore, the reported value of \\(x\\) = 80 is the mean phosphorous in the soil for the data I loaded in the background. If the data change, the mean reported in this document will automatically change too. Make headings, subheadings, bold font, etc. Make a hyperlink. Use latex commands to include in-text equations, i.e., $y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$ renders as \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\); $\\frac{dy}{dt} = e^x$ renders as \\(\\frac{dy}{dt} = e^x\\). (You may need to type require(tinytex) in the Console to get this to work. `The website Detexify is fun for identifying latex commands for different symbols (Some advanced symbols may require packages that you haven’t installed and therfore won’t work)). Try some more complicated Latex. data &lt;- read.csv(&#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahurford/biol-4605-data/main/data/corn.csv&#39;, fill=TRUE) If you would like a more structured introduction to R Markdown you can read R Markdown: the definitive guide. This R markdown cheat sheet is helpful. Some more advanced skills you might learn are making alert boxes, or changing some of the options in the YAML. The alert boxes in this document are made as div class=\"alert alert-info\" between &lt; &gt;, then the text, and closed with /div between &lt; &gt;. My experience making tables in .Rmd has not been good. Usually, I make the table in .docx, print to .pdf, take a screenshot and import the .png to .Rmd or .tex. For your PART I specifically, you need to make a figure in ggplot. For ggplot you need your data as a data frame. The code that I used in the example was: age = seq(1,25) difference = c(-20, -26, -24, -20, -22, -20, -10, 0, 20, 23, 9, 5, 12, 14, 16, 10, 8, 6, 7, 11, 5, 6, 4, 5, 10) data = data.frame(age=age, difference = difference) As you can see, I have guessed the values in the plot and entered them manually. This is okay for the purposes of completing your assignment. (Extra for experts - try a package like scrapR or digitize). You need to install ggplot2. You also need to load that package because we are going to use functions from it now (do this as require(ggplot2)). The code that I used to make my ggplot was: g1=ggplot(data = data, aes(x = age, y = difference)) + geom_point() + geom_line() + xlab(&quot;Adult Age, Days&quot;)+ ylab(&quot;Difference&quot;) g1 If you need to add a title, you can add a layer + ggtitle(\"Your title), to control the axis limits, use + xlim(c(-10,10)) (with the values you need). Generally, you should be able to use an internet search to find what you need. You can also read more about ggplot here. To make your figure caption, just type below where your figure prints. To get bold text, use ** bold text ** (but without space between the ** and the text). The last thing we need is to take a screenshot of the figure you are trying to reproduce, and to include it as a figure. I like to put all my figures in a folder named figure. You can read about including a figure that is a .png or other format. Of the options, I find using knitr::include_graphics() within a code chunk best because it seems easier to control the figure size. The code that I used in my example of how I completed PART I was: Now you have all the information you need to complete PART I, you just need to put the pieces together.

Use head(data) in the Console, or data to view your data (where data is the name I gave my data). head(data) ## X X.1 X.2 X.3 X.4 X.5 X.6 ## 1 NA ## 2 Data for Site 7 NA ## 3 NA ## 4 Plot: 1 NA Plot: 2 ## 5 Date collected Family Genus Species Weight NA Date collected ## 6 01/09/14 Heteromyidae Dipodomys merriami 40 NA 01/08/14 ## X.7 X.8 X.9 X.10 X.11 X.12 X.13 ## 1 NA ## 2 NA ## 3 NA ## 4 NA Plot: 3 ## 5 Family Genus Species Weight NA Date collected Species ## 6 Cricetidae Neotoma albigula -999 NA 1/8 Dipodomys ordii* ## X.14 ## 1 ## 2 ## 3 ## 4 ## 5 Weight ## 6 42 These data are very messy indeed! A helpful command is to know the column names: colnames(data) ## [1] &quot;X&quot; &quot;X.1&quot; &quot;X.2&quot; &quot;X.3&quot; &quot;X.4&quot; &quot;X.5&quot; &quot;X.6&quot; &quot;X.7&quot; &quot;X.8&quot; &quot;X.9&quot; ## [11] &quot;X.10&quot; &quot;X.11&quot; &quot;X.12&quot; &quot;X.13&quot; &quot;X.14&quot; # Extract a row using tidyverse commands dataX =select(data, &quot;X&quot;) # This is base R syntax to extract specifically rows 6 to 14 date.collected = dataX$X[6:14] # as.Date() is needed for R to treat this variable as a date date.collected = as.Date(date.collected, format = &quot;%m/%d/%y&quot;) # This prints to the output, so you can see what I have done date.collected ## [1] &quot;2014-01-09&quot; &quot;2014-01-09&quot; &quot;2014-01-09&quot; &quot;2014-01-09&quot; &quot;2014-01-20&quot; ## [6] &quot;2014-01-20&quot; &quot;2014-03-13&quot; &quot;2014-03-13&quot; &quot;2014-03-13&quot; I will aim to make a data frame with “date collected” and “weight” for Plot 1. Inspecting the data, weight is \"X.4\" for Plot 1. weight = select(data, &quot;X.4&quot;) # as.numeric() is needed because otherwise R doesn&#39;t recognize these data as numbers - which I need for the multiplication later weight = as.numeric(weight$X.4[6:14]) # Make this into a data frame so I can plot using ggplot cleaned.data = data.frame(date.collected, weight) # add a column that is a mutated column cleaned.data = mutate(cleaned.data,weight.kg = weight/1000) # print the cleaned data so we can see what it looks like cleaned.data ## date.collected weight weight.kg ## 1 2014-01-09 40 0.040 ## 2 2014-01-09 36 0.036 ## 3 2014-01-09 135 0.135 ## 4 2014-01-09 39 0.039 ## 5 2014-01-20 43 0.043 ## 6 2014-01-20 144 0.144 ## 7 2014-03-13 51 0.051 ## 8 2014-03-13 44 0.044 ## 9 2014-03-13 146 0.146 Now the data is in a format that I can make a plot: require(ggplot2) g1=ggplot(data = cleaned.data, aes(x = date.collected, y = weight.kg)) + geom_point() + geom_line() + xlab(&quot;Date collected&quot;)+ ylab(&quot;Weight in kg&quot;) g1 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
